        Coffee is more than a morning ritual — it's a culture, a comfort, and a catalyst. From the earthy aroma of freshly ground beans to the energizing first sip, coffee connects people across continents and conversations. Whether it’s a bold espresso, a creamy latte, or a slow pour-over, each cup tells a story of origin, craftsmanship, and personal preference.
        Beyond caffeine, coffee offers moments — of clarity, creativity, or simply calm in the chaos. It’s the pause in a busy day, the spark in a sleepy morning, the warmth in a quiet evening. Brewed in kitchens, cafés, or shared over Zoom calls, coffee is a shared language spoken in every time zone.
